We got our latest batch of cards back from the printer for [SprytnaCards](https://sprytna.cards) (my take on nfc contact sharing)! We are still experimenting with the process of creating new cards and with each run we learn something new! I am most excited to get our next batch of users on the system!

_Sprytna.Cards is currently in closed beta for friends and family, and a few select limited spots. If you are interested, feel free to
 [Request Early Access](https://sprytna.cards/#beta)._

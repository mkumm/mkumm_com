- 3 cups of chicken stock
- 1 green onion
- 1/4 cup of parsley

## Directions

### Prep

- Remove the skins from the sausage and "crumble" the meat.

- Add red pepper, cook for a few minutes.
- Add garlic and cook for about a minute.

- De glaze the pan with the white wine.
- Add the stock and bring to boil.
- Once boiling, bring the temperature down to a simmer.
- Let simmer for about 15 minutes with the top off. Stiff occasionally.
- Rice should taste mostly done (if not, cook an additional 5 minutes with the top on)
- Once rice is done, add parslay and green onion and mix.

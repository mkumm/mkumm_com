## Context

A few months after writing my annual plan—all the things I *have to* get done this year—I came across one of my old notebooks from three years ago. As I flipped through it, I was disappointed to see that my goals back then looked almost identical to the ones I had just written.

That moment made something very clear: it's incredibly hard to make progress on our most important goals without focused effort.

## I Am Learning

[Cal Newport](https://calnewport.com/) helped me articulate feelings I couldn't quite explain, and gave me tools to act on them. I've been reading his books and applying his advice, and the results so far have been really encouraging.

## Results

I'm learning that if I want to do *more* over time, I need to focus on *less* in the present.

I'm still early in this new approach, but I already feel the momentum. I've even completed two things that had been sitting on my list for three years.

If this resonates with you, I recommend checking out Cal's latest book: [Slow Productivity](https://calnewport.com/slow/).

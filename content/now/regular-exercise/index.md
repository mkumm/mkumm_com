## Problem

My energy levels had gotten really low—I was struggling to make it through the day. By Saturday, I barely had enough energy to enjoy even a small part of the weekend. I decided it was time to see if there was something I could do.

## Decision

I gave myself a six-week window to make improving my energy my top priority. After getting blood work done and ruling out anything serious, I began experimenting with eating habits, supplements, and exercise. I won’t list everything I tried, but I basically “discovered” what most people already know.

## What’s Working

What’s made the biggest difference: exercise and a few changes to my eating habits.

- **4 days a week**: I walk to my gym before my morning coffee
  - 20 minutes on the bike
  - 10 minutes on the treadmill
  - Move heavy things
- **3 days a week**: I walk at least 30 minutes
- I eat on a regular schedule: 9:30, 12:30, 3:30, 6:30
- I’ve greatly reduced sugar and highly processed foods
- I taught myself that “taking a break” doesn’t mean “eating junk food”
- Supplements didn’t make a noticeable difference for me

## Results

Three weeks into this routine, my energy is back to what I consider "normal." I haven’t lost any kilograms yet, but my clothes fit noticeably better—which is a great bonus.

I have [Peter Attia](https://peterattiamd.com/) to thank (both his podcast and book) for encouraging me to start where I am and focus on a sustainable pace. I’ve been increasing effort only when I feel ready—and I have no desire to overdo it.

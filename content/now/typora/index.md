## Context

I love [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and use it for nearly all of my writing (including this post)! I have tried most of the markdown editors that hit my radar, including the "second brain" ones like Obsidian, Loqseq and they all had flaws that kept me from loving them. I have been using [Typora](https://typora.io/) and it is as near to perfect as I think I will find. Here is what I love about it about after using it for a couple of months.

## Why I ❤️ Typora

- Natural switching between source and preview views
- Builtin math equations
- Builtin code formatting for everything I use
- It's beautiful
- Rock solid, no glitches, and no latency

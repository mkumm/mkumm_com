## My Shave

About a year ago, I started seeing ads on social media for a sleek-looking single-blade razor—but the price seemed a bit steep. After some digging, I found this little gem on Amazon for about a third of the price: the [Merkur Mk34c Razor](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002A8JO1Q). I've been using it ever since, and I love it.

I really enjoy the feeling of shaving with a single blade again. It reminds you why they used to call shaving a “scrape”—but in the best way. For blades, I use [Astra blades](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001QY8QXM), which cost about 8 cents each.

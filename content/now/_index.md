## Open Office Hours

I love meeting new people and helping however I can. Anyone is welcome—just note that I only speak English.

## Working at DraftKings

I'm currently working at [DraftKings](https://www.draftkings.com/), where I get to write **Elixir** for one of the largest online sportsbooks and casinos—two things I'm passionate about. I'm fortunate to work with some of the brightest and most supportive people in the Elixir community.


## Living in Poland

I've been living in Kraków, Poland for nearly four years, and I really love it. Our apartment is modest, but the location is fantastic—we're just a few hundred yards from a beer garden, my gym, a farmer's market, two regular grocery stores, and a tram stop. The city center is just 20 minutes away, and cheap round-trip flights put most of Europe within easy reach.


## I Built a Thing

I was inspired by people building useful little products, so I decided to try it myself. In about three months (and under $100), I launched [Sprytna.Cards](https://sprytna.cards/) to beta. I'm not sure yet if it can become something people would pay for—but I do have some early adopters who would be genuinely disappointed if it disappeared. That feels like a good start.


## Nauka języka polskiego (Learning Polish)

I'm finally learning to speak Polish. Progress is slow, but I'm really enjoying it. If you're also interested in learning Polish, I highly recommend [Glossa](https://e-polish.eu/polish-for-foreigners)—they work with students worldwide. A special thank you to [Magdalena](https://e-polish.eu/en/polish_teachers_online/magdalena_wygladacz), my wonderful teacher!
